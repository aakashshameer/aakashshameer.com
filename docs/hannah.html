                <h1>Happy 7 months of being together.</h1>
                <p>Hey nah, <br>
                    Happy 7 months of being together. This month particularly has been pretty hard for me with you flying to the UK and you being busy but I will work on it. 
                    I know you have a lot going on right now so I understand if didn‚Äôt remember this time. 3 more months and hopefully we can spend our 10 monthsary together. 
                    I have said this many times but you need to here it again because you always think very low of yourself. <br>
                    You are an amazing human being, nah. üë∏üèºDon‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise. You are intelligent, independent and capable of overcoming anything in your way. 
                    <br> <br> Also, I look through photos of us in my phone every single night before I go to bed and pray that I dream about you so that I can feel close to you when I sleep. 
                    I rush to my phone every time I get a notification, hoping its from you. I have to admit, I do get a little jealous and down when you don‚Äôt call me yet you talk to your other friends but it's fine. I will continue to be a better version of myself. <br>
                    <br> Take care in the UK, princess. 
                    <br>
                    Love you always ü§ç
                </p>

        <h1>Here are a few memories from our 7 months relationship (so far).</h1>
        <p> These are the photos I look through every night before I sleep and think how lucky I am to be able to say I love you to this human being. <br>
            <br> I have tried my best to insert this in chronological order but in all honesty these are just pictures I really like of us.  </p>

                <h1>The time I bought you flowers for your birthday.</h1>
                <p>I totally liked you at this time and I wanted to surprise you with flowers. <br>
                And when the flowers reached your place, you immidiately knew that I sent it because of the delivery instructions and the fact I called you, "nah".
            <br>It said, "Make sure the recipient gets the flowers, her number is attached to the order".</p>

                <p>I asked you before I went to the US if you would be my valentine and you said "yes". <br> 
                    So for valentine's day, I sent you flowers. You really liked them and I was happy. <br>
                <br> This was also before we started dating so it was a little weird but it was the start of our relationship. </p>

                <h1>The time you used to facetime me constantly before we were dating.</h1>
                <p>This is one of the many photos I took when you kept calling me because I was confused on why you always wanted to talk to me.
                    Here I am so far away from home and the girl I like is facetiming me. I also really liked how you look with the sun on your face and 
                    your hair tied up like that.

                <p>This is a picture we took when I asked you to be my girlfriend. I was always attracted to you and was shocked that you knew I liked you. <br>
                    We talked the whole night and it was probably the happiest moment of my life. It was 6 am and I didn't feel an ounce of being tired. <br>
                    The truth is that you make me happy nah. My mood will change around you and my problems would go away. <br> <br>

                <h1>The time you wore the necklace I bought you.</h1>
                <p>Funny story here. I told you I bought you the necklace from Genting Highlands which was where I saw the necklace at Lovisa, but I couldn't buy it without my mum knowing. One day, after work, I went to One Utama and bought you the exact necklace. I was so nervous the entire day leading up to the moment I gave it to you. I thought that you would be weird about it but you weren't. I love you.

                This was on our 6-monthsary and I wanted to spend some time with you but you were busy so I surprised you with flowers. <br> <br>
            I was kinda sad on this day. I had the feeling that you didn't want to spend time with me and you value your friends more than me because you brought them to your mum's boss place and had a meal. You would never do that with me but it's fine. I was also sad because you didn't want to share the picture on your Instagram but you did it later on. However, that didn't stop you for looking like a princess in this photo.  <br>

                <h1>The time we went on a date IN REAL LIFE.</h1>
                <p>This wasn't the first time we went on a date but this was the first time we took a picture together in real life, just the two of us. <br>
                We had Burger King and I would hold your hand while I drive which you wouldn't like but you still allowed me to hold it anyways.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>That is some of the memories we had nah since we started dating. While we have had our fair share of fights, for this past 7 months, you have made me the happiest person in the world. <br> <br>
        Happy 7 months! <i class="fas fa-heart"></i></p>
